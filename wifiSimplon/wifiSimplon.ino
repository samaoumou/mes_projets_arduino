/*
  ReadField
  
  Description: Demonstates reading from a public channel which requires no API key and reading from a private channel which requires a read API key.
               The value read from the public channel is the current outside temperature at MathWorks headquaters in Natick, MA.  The value from the
               private channel is an example counter that increments every 10 seconds.
  
  Hardware: ESP32 based boards
  
  !!! IMPORTANT - Modify the secrets.h file for this project with your network connection and ThingSpeak channel details. !!!
  
  Note:
  - Requires installation of EPS32 core. See https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md for details. 
  - Select the target hardware from the Tools->Board menu
  - This example is written for a network using WPA encryption. For WEP or WPA, change the WiFi.begin() call accordingly.
